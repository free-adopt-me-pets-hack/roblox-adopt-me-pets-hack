Tasks that give you money are usually shown in green. Some games have tasks that give you money, but the amount is not as large as it could be.

***Trading Pets***



Adopt me is a game where you can adopt pets for free, and the pets that you get are of the same rarity as your own. This means that if you have a pet that is rare, and you want to trade with someone that has a pet that is rare, you can do this. However, you cannot trade with a player that has a rare pet with a common pet.

There is a reason why you can't do this, but it's because you're basically trying to sell a rare pet for a common pet, and there isn't any way to do this, which is why it is not allowed.

So, to start off, you need to make sure that you have a rare pet, and then you need to go into the trade menu by pressing 'E' on the keyboard. Then you need to approach someone who has a pet that is of the same rarity as your own.

When you are in the trade menu, you can click 'Request Pet'. This will open up the trade menu and you can choose whether you want to sell or buy the pet.

If you are trying to trade a pet that is rarer than you have, then you'll have to trade a common pet for a rare pet. If you want to trade a common pet for a rare pet, then you'll need to trade a common pet for a common pet. Once you've made your choice, the trade will start. The trade will be sent out, and the other person will receive it. They will then have to complete the same amount of tasks as you did in order to raise the pet.
